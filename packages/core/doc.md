Here’s a simplified explanation of the PotraceOptions, suitable for non-experts, with examples and common settings for different use cases like logos, doodles, and images.

What is Potrace?

Potrace is a tool that turns black-and-white images (or simplified versions of color images) into smooth, scalable vector graphics. These vectors can be used for logos, illustrations, or other designs.

Here’s how each setting works and what they do:

1. turdSize

	•	What it does: Removes tiny, unwanted details (like small specks or noise).
	•	Default value: 2
	•	How to use it:
	•	A small value (e.g., 1) keeps more details.
	•	A large value (e.g., 10) removes tiny details, making the result cleaner.
	•	Example:
	•	For logos: Use 10 to keep the shapes clean and bold.
	•	For doodles: Use 1-3 to preserve smaller strokes.

2. turnPolicy

	•	What it does: Decides how Potrace draws corners when there’s a choice to go left, right, or follow black/white areas.
	•	Default value: 'minority' (favors turning around the smaller color area).
	•	How to use it:
	•	For sharp corners, try 'black' or 'white'.
	•	For smooth designs, 'majority' often works well.
	•	Example:
	•	For logos: Use 'majority' to get smoother curves.
	•	For doodles: Use 'left' or 'right' to give it a hand-drawn feel.

3. alphaMax

	•	What it does: Controls how smooth the curves are.
	•	Default value: 1.0 (maximum smoothness).
	•	How to use it:
	•	Lower it (e.g., 0.5) to keep sharper corners.
	•	Use 1.0 for smooth and flowing shapes.
	•	Example:
	•	For logos: Use 1.0 for smooth, professional shapes.
	•	For doodles: Use 0.5 for a more angular, hand-drawn style.

4. optCurve

	•	What it does: Simplifies the vector path to use fewer points, making the file smaller and easier to edit.
	•	Default value: true
	•	How to use it:
	•	Leave it as true for most cases.
	•	Set to false if you want more detail.
	•	Example:
	•	For images: Keep true to simplify the output.
	•	For doodles: Use false if you want to keep more detail.

5. optTolerance

	•	What it does: Adjusts how much Potrace simplifies curves when optCurve is true.
	•	Default value: 0.2
	•	How to use it:
	•	Lower values (e.g., 0.1) keep more detail but make the file larger.
	•	Higher values (e.g., 0.5) create simpler, smoother shapes.
	•	Example:
	•	For logos: Use 0.3-0.5 for clean and bold designs.
	•	For doodles: Use 0.1 to keep small curves.

6. threshold

	•	What it does: Determines what parts of the image are black or white.
	•	Default value: 128 (midpoint, treats lighter grays as white and darker grays as black).
	•	How to use it:
	•	Lower values (e.g., 50) make more of the image black.
	•	Higher values (e.g., 200) make more of the image white.
	•	Example:
	•	For logos: Use 128 or adjust until the shapes look bold.
	•	For images: Adjust based on brightness to get clear shapes.

7. blackOnWhite

	•	What it does: Tells Potrace whether the image is black shapes on a white background.
	•	Default value: true
	•	How to use it:
	•	For white shapes on a black background, set it to false.
	•	Example:
	•	For inverted logos (white text on black): Use false.
	•	For normal black text or shapes on white: Use true.

Suggested Settings

Here are some presets you can try for different types of graphics:

For a logo (clean and bold shapes):

{
  turdSize: 10,
  turnPolicy: 'majority',
  alphaMax: 1.0,
  optCurve: true,
  optTolerance: 0.3,
  threshold: 128,
  blackOnWhite: true
}

For a doodle (hand-drawn feel):

{
  turdSize: 1,
  turnPolicy: 'left',
  alphaMax: 0.5,
  optCurve: false,
  optTolerance: 0.1,
  threshold: 100,
  blackOnWhite: true
}

For an image (simple vector from photo):

{
  turdSize: 3,
  turnPolicy: 'minority',
  alphaMax: 0.7,
  optCurve: true,
  optTolerance: 0.2,
  threshold: 150,
  blackOnWhite: true
}

These settings are a starting point—you can tweak them to match your image and design style!
